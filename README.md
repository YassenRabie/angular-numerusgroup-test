**Please Note:** The API connected to the client side is hosted on a free server using Render, so the initial request might be slow due to the server startup.

## Local Installation Guide

###### Follow these steps to run the project locally:

After cloning the project, begin by running the server. Execute the following steps:
1. Navigate to the server folder using `cd server`
2. Install the required packages with `npm i`
3. Launch the server with `npm run start` (Note: If you prefer to start the server in dev mode, you must first install `nodemon` globally and then use the command `npm run dev`)

Once the server is running, proceed to the client folder to initiate the client app:
1. Navigate to the client folder using `cd client`
2. Install the required packages with `npm i`
3. Launch the application with the command `ng serve --open`

Note: The API URL and Recaptcha key are provided with the repository for simplified installation.
